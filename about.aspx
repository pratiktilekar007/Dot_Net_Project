A long awaited dream of two budding entrepreneurs was nearing fruition with the
launch of a premium ice cream parlor. The Ice-Cream Bakery opened its first outlet
 at Vashi, Mumbai, on September 15, 2016. With a 6 year experience in the fast food industry,
  the founders of TiB started off on a journey to bring the best of fresh fruit,chocolate based & some
   exquisite flavours LIVE to people. The concept of ice cream has been taken to the next level at TiB. The idea
    of creating LIVE ice creams in front of customers is a gentle tease to their taste buds for this age old favourite dessert.
     After all, TiB clearly believes that ice cream is a feeling.
